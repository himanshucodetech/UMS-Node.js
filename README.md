User management System Using Node.js ,API and EJS 

####Here is brief overview of how i am create user management system in Node.js , API and EJS.

1. Create a new Node.js project: You can create a new Node.js project using the `npm init` command. This will create a `package.json` file, which will contain the configuration details of your project.

2. Install the necessary dependencies: You will need to install the following dependencies for this project: `express`, `ejs`, `body-parser`, `mongoose`, and `bcryptjs`. You can install them by running the following command: `npm install express ejs body-parser mongoose bcryptjs`.

3. Set up the project structure: Create a `views` folder and inside that, create a `layouts` folder, and create two EJS files inside it - `header.ejs` and `footer.ejs`. Create another folder called `partials`, and inside it, create two EJS files - `messages.ejs` and `form-fields.ejs`. Create a `public` folder to store static assets like CSS and JS files. Create a `routes` folder and create two files inside it - `auth.js` and `users.js`. Finally, create a `models` folder and create a `user.js` file inside it.

4. Set up the database: You will need to set up a MongoDB database for this project. You can create a free account on MongoDB Atlas and create a new cluster. Then, create a new database and a new collection called `users`. You can get the connection string by clicking on "Connect" and selecting "Connect Your Application". Copy the connection string and replace `<password>` with your actual password. Save this connection string as an environment variable in a `.env` file.

5. Create a user model: In the `user.js` file, create a new schema for the `User` model using the `mongoose` library. Add the following fields to the schema: `name`, `email`, `password`, and `createdAt`. Use the `bcryptjs` library to hash the password before saving it to the database.

6. Create the authentication routes: In the `auth.js` file, create two routes - `/login` and `/register`. The `/login` route should display a login form, and the `/register` route should display a registration form. When the form is submitted, the server should validate the form data and authenticate the user. If the user is authenticated, redirect them to the dashboard page.

7. Create the user management routes: In the `users.js` file, create four routes - `/users`, `/users/:id/edit`, `/users/:id/update`, and `/users/:id/delete`. The `/users` route should display a list of all users. The `/users/:id/edit` route should display a form to edit the user's details. The `/users/:id/update` route should update the user's details in the database. The `/users/:id/delete` route should delete the user from the database.

8. Create the views: Create the following EJS files - `login.ejs`, `register.ejs`, `dashboard.ejs`, `users.ejs`, `edit-user.ejs`, and `messages.ejs`. The `login.ejs` and `register.ejs` files should contain the login and registration forms, respectively. The `dashboard.ejs` file should display a welcome message and a link to view all users. The `users.ejs` file should display a table of all users and a link to edit each user. The `edit-user.ejs` file should contain a form to edit the user's details. The `messages.ejs` file should contain

######BriefÂ introduction of login, signup, OTP, and email verification process in detail.

1. Signup Process:
The signup process is where a user can register themselves on the platform. The user will fill in their details such as name, email, and password, which will then be sent to the server. The server will validate the data, hash the password, and save the user's details to the database. Additionally, the server will generate an OTP (One-Time Password) and send it to the user's email address.

2. Email Verification Process:
After the user has signed up, they will receive an email with the OTP. The user must enter the OTP on the platform to verify their email address. Once the OTP is validated, the user's email will be marked as verified, and they can access the platform.

3. Login Process:
The login process is where a user can log in to the platform using their email and password. The user will enter their credentials on the login form, which will be sent to the server. The server will validate the credentials, and if they are correct, the user will be logged in and redirected to the dashboard page.

4. OTP Verification Process:
In some cases, a platform may require additional security measures, such as OTP verification. After the user has logged in, they may be prompted to enter an OTP sent to their phone or email address. The user must enter the correct OTP to access the platform.

To implement the above features, In this project i use various libraries and frameworks. Here are a few examples:

1. For the signup process, you can use libraries like `bcryptjs` for password hashing, `jsonwebtoken` for generating JSON Web Tokens, and `nodemailer` for sending emails.

2. For the email verification process, you can use the `nodemailer` library to send emails with the OTP, and save the OTP to the database for validation.

3. For the login process, you can use libraries like `passport` or `jsonwebtoken` for authentication and authorization.

4. For the OTP verification process, you can use services like Twilio or Nexmo for sending SMS OTPs or use `nodemailer` to send email OTPs.
